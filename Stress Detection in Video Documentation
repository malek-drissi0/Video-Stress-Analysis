**Overview
This project is designed to analyze stress levels in a video by integrating various factors such as emotion, mouth movement, head movement, and eyeblink frequency. The system employs pre-trained models for emotion detection and utilizes computer vision techniques for facial feature analysis.

**Requirements
Before running the project, make sure to install the required packages using the following commands:
!pip install opencv-python
!pip install deepface

**Code Structure
The project consists of the following components:

1)Import Libraries and Modules:

!pip install opencv-python
!pip install deepface
import cv2
from deepface import DeepFace
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import make_interp_spline

2)Load Pre-trained Models:
Load the emotion detection model using DeepFace:
model = DeepFace.build_model("Emotion")

3)Define emotion labels.
Load Haar Cascade Classifiers:

4)Load the face, mouth, and eye cascade classifiers for feature detection.
Initialize Variables:

5)Initialize variables and weights for stress factors.
Video Processing Loop:
*Read frames from the input video.
*Detect faces, eyes, and mouths in the frames.
*Calculate stress levels based on emotion, mouth movement, head movement, and eyeblink frequency.
*Update stress level variables and store data for plotting.
*Display the processed frames.

6)Data Plotting:
Interpolate stress level data for smoother curves.
Plot stress levels over time for emotions, mouth movement, head movement, eyeblink, and aggregated stress.

7)Release Resources:
Release the video capture and close all windows.


**How to Use
1)Install the required packages.
2)Adjust the paths to the Haar cascade classifiers (mouth_cascade and eye_cascade) based on your system)
3)Set the correct path for the input video (video_path).
4)Run the script, and the stress levels will be displayed over time for different factors.

**Notes
1)Ensure that the required Haar cascade XML files are available on your system.
2)Modify weights and thresholds based on the desired sensitivity of stress factors.
3)Press 'q' to exit the video processing loop.
